    "Purpose: Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is used to systematically search for the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It helps in tuning the model to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "Define Hyperparameter Space: Specify the hyperparameters and the range of values to be tested.\n",
    "Cross-Validation: For each combination of hyperparameters, perform k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "Evaluate Performance: Calculate the performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) for each fold and average them.\n",
    "Select Best Parameters: Choose the combination of hyperparameters that provides the best performance.\n"

    "Search Method: Exhaustively searches all possible combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Pros: Guarantees finding the best combination within the specified grid.\n",
    "Cons: Computationally expensive, especially with a large number of hyperparameters and wide ranges.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Search Method: Samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from the specified ranges.\n",
    "Pros: More efficient and less computationally expensive, can find good hyperparameters quicker.\n",
    "Cons: May not find the absolute best combination since it doesn't explore all possibilities.\n",
    "When to Choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: When you have a small hyperparameter space and can afford the computational cost.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: When you have a large hyperparameter space or need a quicker solution."
